RememberMe: Your Digital Memory Journal on Sui
RememberMe is the ideal place to immortalize your favorite moments. Every memory you record becomes a unique digital token (NFT) on the Sui blockchain, guaranteeing it is timestamped and preserved forever.

Practical User Guide
The application is designed to be simple and direct, focused on two main actions: creating memories and viewing them.

1. Getting Started (Wallet Connection)
Before you can start saving your memories or viewing your journal, you must connect your Sui wallet.

Action: Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the upper right corner.

Result: Your Sui address appears, and the application is ready to record and display your NFTs.

2. Creating a New Memory ("Check-in")
This is the unique way RememberMe allows you to record a moment. Instead of filling out a form directly in the application, you use a special pre-created link.

How It Works:

Generate Your Link: (Imagine you receive a link containing all the details of your memory: Name, Photo, Location, and Description).

Open the Link: When you open this special link in your browser, the application immediately detects it.

Verification (ConfirmModal): A confirmation window appears, showing all the memory's details. This allows you to verify that everything is accurate.

Final Save: If you are connected and the details are correct, click "Confirm." The application signs the transaction and mints your new NFT directly onto the blockchain.

Result: The memory is now permanent and appears in your journal!

3. Consulting Your Memory Journal (Timeline)
Once connected, you access your personal NFT Timeline.

Chronological View: All your memory NFTs are displayed in order, from newest to oldest. You can relive your history at a glance.

Entry Details: Each memory card displays:

The name and image of the memory.

The exact date and time (thanks to the Sui clock).

A brief description.

The unique NFT ID.

View Location: Click the "Show on map" button on any memory. A window will open to show you the exact location where that moment was recorded, using a static map image.

What You Own (The NFT)
Every recorded memory is a "memory" type NFT object.

It is the digital proof, verifiable on the blockchain, that this memory belongs to you.

The data (Name, URL, Location, Description) is immutable once minted, guaranteeing its integrity for the future.
